# Teacher-Aide-Web-Apps
Submitting and searching applications

This project contains two web applications.  One web app is designed for students to be able to submit an application for a job as a teacher's assistant.  The other web app is developed for employers to search through the applications.  A MySQL database is used to store and retrieve students' applications.  I made this project with a partner.  The main web page to view this project is mysql.html.  The text file named table shows the table that was created in the MySQL database.  Since this project was done on a school server, the database that was set up for this project is not maintained by me or my partner.
